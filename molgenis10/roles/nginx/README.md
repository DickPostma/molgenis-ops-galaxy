The nginx role creates a proxy that listens on port tcp/80 and forwards that traffic either to molgenis running tomcat (backend) or the remote unpkg.com server for the frontend components. The molgenis-theme frontend needs to be proxy-passed from unpkg otherwise the icons within it will not load properly. So all frontends are redirected except the molgenis-theme that nginx needs to proxy pass. On Ubuntu 22.04 the new OpenSSL >= 3.0.0 will not work properly with old unkpg.com server, we have a workaround in place on a local mirror server unpkg.molgeniscloud.org.
